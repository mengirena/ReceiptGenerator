## Lesson learnt

### What is Axios?

Axios is very similar to Fetch API. It can be used to make HTTP request from node.js or XMLHttpRequests from the browser. It's a JavaScript library so we have to import it to use it. When we use `fetch()`, we have to transfer the response to json first and then we can get the data we want. Using Axios, we don't have to worry about it.
